# system-setup

This repository contains scripts to automate my personal setup of arch linux. It is intended to streamline the initial system configuration on fresh installs up to the display manager. I have a separate script for installing applications and mapping dotfiles.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/stuart-russell/system-setup.git
    ```
2. Run the script **not as sudo**:
    ```sh
    sh run.sh
    ```
